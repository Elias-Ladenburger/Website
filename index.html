    <p class="text-gray-400">This page is nothing but an empty husk at the moment. Pure, innocent, unformatted HTML. Maybe I will get round to writing some CSS to spice things up soon. Maybe I will instead use this site for some protoytping and experimenting. Maybe I will do none of these things.</p>
    <p>In any case, I hope you have had a wonderful day. If not and you came looking for something to cheer you up, I can recommend talking a walk in nature. Or looking at pictures of cats. Either way, I wish you a fantastic life.</p>
