<p>Combining technical understanding with people skills.</p>
  <p>  
    For small and mid-size firms without technical expertise, I am "the one to go to for technical questions".
    I help conceptualize ideas on how to improve your online shop or website. 
    I either implement your ideas directly or find and supervise an expert who can.

    For enterprises, I am an interim product manager for hire. 
    I help you specify requirements. 
    I coordinate between your stakeholders and development team. 
    I analyze your processes and meeting hygiene and help you relentlessly improve.</p>
