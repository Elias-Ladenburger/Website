  <p class="text-lg md:mx-24 ">I am a freelancer who walks the line between business and technology.
    This allows me to be your <b class="bg-primaryContrast text-primary">general practitioner for tech</b>: Your <b>first point of contact for all questions relating to software development, procurement and management</b>.
    I have a foot in the world of small companies and large corporates alike. 
    <br/><br/>
    <b class="bg-primaryContrast text-primary">Small and medium enterprises (SMEs)</b> do not always have the capacity for full-time experts in software development, product management or cyber security.
    Their focus is on building, marketing and selling their core product and rightfully so.
    They have the same needs for technology as their large-scale counterparts, but often less frequently and on a smaller scale.
    Much like a layperson who counts on a medical general practitioner, I will <b>refer you to the right technical expert</b> and prepare any documents you may need on the way.
    <b>Just like GPs do in medicine, most technical tasks can be solved by an experienced tech generalist.</b>
    <br/><br/>
    <b class="bg-primaryContrast text-primary">Corporates</b> typically profit from project managers who can <b>keep an overview</b> of the many technical and organizational details of a project.
    Somebody who can <b>navigate the needs of different stakeholders</b> and speak to developers and executives alike.
    I "grew up" in a corporate environment and will integrate seamlessly into your internal process for product management or software project management.
    I hold various certifications on Scrum, SAFe and general product management and will leverage my experience and outsider perspective to help you <b>relentlessly improve your processes</b>.
